# âœ¨FundQuest âœ¨ (Ethereum Smart Contracts based Fund Raising Campaign) 

## ðŸ”´ What is this? ðŸ¤”

#### 
 - As we know that there are a lot of people who need some financial support to improve their living conditions. 
 - A little bit of support can make their living better. 
 - So this is a project made for supporting these group of people by starting various campaigns like flood relief campaign, support orphanage etc.

## ðŸ”µ Now why to use blockchain? 

#### 
 - As we know that there are many fraud people who take money in the name of donations and use them to buy assest for themselves. 
 - No one knows that whether their valuable donations delivered on the needy organizations, or wheather the money will meet backer's expectations. 
 - So this project is made to make all these donations secure and monitor them. 

## ðŸŸ£ Why not other techstack?

### Let me tell you the drawbacks of using other techstack: 
####
 - Money is given to the campaign owner. No-one knows whether in future he will give the money to the needy organization or not.
 - If we assume that the owner is genuine but still although neccesary measures such as symmetric encryption are in place to make e-payment safe and secure, it is still vulnerable to hacking. 
 - Enterprises with in-house e-payment systems have to spend additional costs in procuring, installing and maintaining sophisticated payment-security technologies. 
 - Then why not to use only one ethereum smart contract to solve all these bunch of problems. 

## ðŸŸ¢ Features of the project

####
 - The website will show the list of all the open campaigns. 
 - Anyone can create a new campaign or contribute to an existing campaign. He/She just need to have a metamask account to made the transactions. 
 - After a contribution is made, then the donated amount goes directly to the deployed address. 
 - Whenever a campaign owner need to send the collected money to needy, it will send a request to all the contributors of that campaign, and they can acknowledge the requests through their votes.
 - The money is directly transferred to the requested account if a minimum number of contributors approve a certain request, here I kept that number as 50% or above. 
 - The campaign owner finalize the request and the amount is directly transferred to the needy's account.
 - Any kind of unfair practice will cancel the transaction.
